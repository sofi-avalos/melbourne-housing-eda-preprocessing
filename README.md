# Melbourne Housing Market — Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering workflow
applied to the Melbourne Housing dataset. The objective is to understand the structure of
the data and prepare it for downstream machine learning tasks through statistical analysis
and feature transformation.

## 📌 Project Overview

Real estate datasets often contain missing values, skewed distributions, and categorical
features that require careful preprocessing before modeling.  
This project focuses on transforming raw housing data into a machine-learning-ready format
using common data science techniques.
